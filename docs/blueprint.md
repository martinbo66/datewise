## Original User Request:
Let's work in architect mode. We plan only. Don't create any code until I type "ACT". Help plan an app that selects a list of dates based on natural language description. For example, "every Wednesday in May" would assume the current year (2025) and select 5/7/25, 5/14/25, 5/21/25, and 5/28/25. The app would display the dates in a list and also on a calendar.
